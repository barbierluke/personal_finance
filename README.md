# personal_finance
This repository serves as a tool to track income and expenditures. It includes visualization tools such as Line Charts and Pie Charts using python's matplotlib (python is more in my domain than excel...). See the *How to Use* section for guidance steps on using the software. The repo includes a file to enter data as either a day expenditure/income or a reocurring expenditure/income with support for grouping expenditures in lists (Such as going to the grocery store). Upon entering data, utilize the Wiki's *Object Hierarchy* for codes corresponding to to different expenditures and incomes. See *Income / Expense Data Structure* for the format in which this data is saved. After data entry, this repo provides a separate file for visualizing the saved data in different ways. Note: the income / expense data is intentionally included in the gitignore for privacy.
